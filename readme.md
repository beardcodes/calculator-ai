beardnetworks built the Smart AI Calculator app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by calculator ai at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way.

Third Party Services (Gemini API)

Our app uses Google Gemini API (Generative AI) to provide the "Smart Math" and "Explain Number" features.

When you use the AI features (e.g., asking a question or requesting an explanation for a number), the text of your query is sent to Google's servers for processing.

Data Sent: The mathematical query or number you input.

Purpose: To generate the answer or explanation displayed in the app.

Retention: We (the app developer) do not store your queries or the AI's responses on any external server. They are transient and only exist on your device during the session.

Please note that the third-party service provider (Google) has their own Privacy Policy regarding how they handle API data:
