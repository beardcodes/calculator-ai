        When you use the AI features (e.g., asking a question or requesting an explanation for a number),

        <li><strong>Data Sent:</strong> The mathematical query or number you input.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To generate the answer or explanation displayed in the app.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>
